## Struggles:

One of the main challenges faced during the development of this project was the time management for each question. The timer had to be implemented, which meant that the user only had a certain amount of time to answer each question. I had to ensure that the timer worked accurately and the user could not manipulate the timer.

## Functionality:

The application allows users to select a category of interest and answer multiple-choice questions within a specific time frame. Users can navigate between questions using navigation buttons and submit their scores to the database at the end of the game. The application can display the top scores.

## Contribute:
I used to always look for projects to contribute to but felt discouraged by the negativity in some repo communities or projects that were too advanced for my current skills. That's why I make all my projects open-source at a moderate beginner level and welcome contributors from all experiences. Create more questions, add more features, and have fun!
